The `useLocation` hook in React Router is used to return the current location of a React component. The `useLocation` returns the current location as an object and comes with props such as

pathname
state
search
key
hash
These props can be used with useEffect hook to perform side effects such as clicks onScroll or return state parsed to a Link component.

Location Object Properties
pathname: The current route path (e.g., /employees/123).
search: The query string in the URL (e.g., ?name=John).
state: Data passed via navigation (e.g., employee details in the code).

Common Use Cases
1.Access route-specific data:
Read data passed from one route to another using state.
2.Dynamic behavior based on the current route:
Determine what to display based on the pathname.
3.Access query parameters:
Parse search to retrieve query strings.
